# Day 4: Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on medical attributes, using the Breast Cancer dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

- Loaded Breast Cancer dataset
- Performed EDA (basic inspection)
- Train-Test split (80-20)
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC Curve and AUC Score

---

## 📈 Final Model Results

| Metric | Score |
|:---|:---|
| **Accuracy** | 97% |
| **Precision (Class 0)** | 98% |
| **Recall (Class 0)** | 95% |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 97% |
| **Recall (Class 1)** | 99% |
| **F1 Score** | 97% |
| **ROC AUC Score** | ~ |
